Streets are closed at 5pm. We suggest that you drop your set up materials near your location prior to the streets being closed at 5pm.  Once the streets are closed, getting close to your set up spot will be more difficult as you will have to cross barricades.  If that is the case, please enter from Massachusetts on to Cedar to unload your set up.  All cars must be removed from the streets, so you <STRONG>WILL NOT<\/STRONG> be able to park near your spot.  You may park in the Main Street garage or the permitted lot on the corner of Massachusetts and Cedar, directly across the street from the Main Street garage. See STREET CLOSURE MAP.<BR> • Set up is in the streets' parking spaces along Kentucky Ave.<BR> • The DLP does not provide tables, chairs, tents or any other items for your set up.  Limited electricity, unlimited smiles, and crowds of people are all we have to offer!<BR> • Please respond EACH MONTH to the emails requesting your participation and activity at your booth.<BR> • Once you notify us of your planned participation, we will email you a location for that month a few days before the event.  Locations change to ensure that there is proper rotation for members. Please be sure to respond to the monthly emails regarding First Friday participation.<\/P>\r\n<P><SPAN STYLE=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">• Please be sure to clean up your area upon leaving, making sure any trash or stray paper did not fall to the ground.

Shore is still performing stand-up comedy and toured in 2012. Shore was born Paul Montgomery Shore, the son of Mitzi Shore (née Saidel), who founded The Comedy Store, and Sammy Shore, a comedian. Shore was raised Jewish, and grew up in Beverly Hills, California. He graduated from Beverly Hills High School in 1986. Stand-up career Inspired by his parents’ work in comedy and show business, a 17-year-old Shore made his stand-up debut at the Alley Cat Bistro in Culver City. “Everyone else in school was filling out their SAT applications, but I just passed mine back. I knew I wasn’t going to go to college.” Shore was mentored by Sam Kinison and opened several of his sets. While touring the comedy club circuit, Shore cultivated an alter ego persona, “The Weasel”. “The Weasel” involved Shore speaking in a Jeff Spicoli-esque surfer parlance, heavily peppered with dudespeak slang such as “edged”, “melons” and “grinding” as well as his catchphrase, “Hey, BU-DDY.” Shore’s big break came as an on-air MTV VJ, a position he held from 1989 to 1994. At the height of his MTV fame, Shore had his own show, Totally Pauly, serving as a host, most memorably on MTV’s annual Spring Break parties. He also released a music video, “Lisa, Lisa, The One I Adore”. Film career In 1992, Shore starred in Encino Man which was a modest hit. Encino Man’s success propelled Shore to star in additional personalized vehicles, albeit less successful: Son in Law (1993), In the Army Now (1994), Jury Duty (1995), and Bio-Dome (1996). He makes a cameo appearance in the American rock band Limp Bizkit music video “N 2 Gether Now”, as a pizza deliveryman, and a briefer appearance in Break Stuff. In 2003, Shore produced, wrote, directed and starred in Pauly Shore Is Dead, a semi-autobiographical mockumentary, and in 2005 starred in the short lived reality television series Minding the Store. In 2010 Shore starred in Adopted, which sees him traveling to Africa to adopt a child. In addition, he has several short subject films and multiple projects in the works such as his MTV pilot called The Shores and various projects with such as Funny or Die.<\/P>\r\n<P>For more Information, contact us at 863-644-9464 or <A HREF=\"http:\/\/www.WinnersCircleSportsBar.com\" REL=\"nofollow\">www.WinnersCircleSportsBar.com<\/A><\/P>\r\n<P> <\/P>","capacity":125,"box_text_color":"CECBAF","tickets":[{"ticket":{"id":21889497,"min":1,"end_date":"2014-09-16 18:00:00","price":"27.37","max":null,"visible":"true","description":"$25 tickets - CASH ONLY at Winners Circle","name":"Comedy with Pauly Shore - Tues (7pm show)","include_fee":"false","type":0,"display_price":"25.00","currency":"USD"}}],"background_color":"677479","box_background_color":"677479","tags":"Comedy, Lakeland, Winners Circle, Comedy Club, Fun","logo":"http:\/\/cdn.evbuc.com\/images\/3540143\/14314634903\/2\/logo.jpg","status":"Live","box_border_color":"677479","organizer":{"id":1089865023,"long_description":"Winnners Circle Sports Bar & Grill is a 150 person capacity full liquor sportsbar in south Lakeland, Florida.
